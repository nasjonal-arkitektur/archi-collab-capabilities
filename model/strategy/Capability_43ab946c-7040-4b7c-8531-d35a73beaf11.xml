Ability to enforce the policies within the layer, behaving as a Policy Enforcer. Ability to support the audit and logging of runtime service usage to support QoS attributes, with the potential use of standards such as CBE and XDAS to ensure consistent and interoperable data which can then be easily integrated with the Quality of Service Layer to support capabilities such as service monitoring, audit, compliance, and runtime governance.
