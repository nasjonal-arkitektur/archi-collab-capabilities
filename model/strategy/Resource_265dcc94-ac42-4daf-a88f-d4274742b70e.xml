This ABB is one of the core functional ABBs in SOA RA. Typically, a service is published to the Service Repository ABB in the Governance Layer during design time for search and re-use and the Service Registry ABB in the Governance Layer during runtime for service virtualizaton. A service is typically represented in a standard description language (e.g., WSDL) describing its accessible interfaces (e.g., function or method signatures). Service is one of the fundamental constructs of an SOA solution and analysis and design based on the service-oriented paradigm.">
