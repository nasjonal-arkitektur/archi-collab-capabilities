This ABB enables the hosting and exposure of information services by the SOA RA, forming a virtual data layer. It thus supports interfacing between the Information Layer and consumers of information services and is critical to expose Information as a Service (IaaS). It provides a consistent entry point to the Information Layer through multiple mechanisms such as messaging, service calls, and batch processing. This ABB leverages capabilities and ABBs from the Integration Layer.">
