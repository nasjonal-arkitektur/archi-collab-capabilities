    documentation="DESCRIPTION:&#xD;&#xA;Shares the functionality of the verification of timestamps used for establishing evidence that a give piece of data existed at a given point in time.&#xD;&#xA;An ‘electronic time stamp’ means data in electronic form which binds other data in electronic form to a particular time establishing evidence that the latter data existed at that time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Based on eIDAS - REGULATION (EU) No 910/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC.&#xD;&#xA;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Syn. eTS Creation Service&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;INTEROPERABILITY SALIENCY:&#xD;&#xA;The e-Timestamp Creation Service ABB  is salient for technical interoperability because it provides &#xD;&#xA;the functionalities required for e-Timestamp creation service.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;EXAMPLES:&#xD;&#xA;The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB):&#xD;&#xA;DigiStamp eTimeStamp®&#xD;&#xA;DigiStamp eTimeStamp® protects the intellectual property in any computer file:&#xD;&#xA;• Use Desktop and Web applications for on-demand protection&#xD;&#xA;• Plug the Timestamp Authority into the automated systems&#xD;&#xA;Plug-in rigorous implementation of US &amp; EU standards:&#xD;&#xA;• Secure, reliable, RFC 3161 timestamp cloud service&#xD;&#xA;• Archiving and Hash Chaining keyless security&#xD;&#xA;• Elliptic Curve Upgrade&#xD;&#xA;Implementation of the Internet Engineering Task Force's RFC 3161 means DigiStamp timestamps are understood by data validation systems the world over:&#xD;&#xA;• Implementation of ANSI X9.95 further increases the compatibility of our timestamps.&#xD;&#xA;• Compliance with IETF RFC 3628 gives credence to the trustworthiness of our Time Stamp Authorities.&#xD;&#xA;• Conformance to IETF RFC 3126 makes our timestamps usable for long-term, legally binding agreements.&#xD;&#xA;https://www.digistamp.com/ &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;freeTSA.org offers free NTP and DNSCRYPT services&#xD;&#xA;freeTSA.org provides a free Time Stamp Authority. Adding a trusted timestamp to code or to an electronic signature provides a digital seal of data integrity and a trusted date and time of when the transaction took place.&#xD;&#xA;Trusted timestamping is the process of securely keeping track of the creation and modification times of a document. Security here means that no one - not even the owner of the document - should be able to change it once it has been recorded provided that the timestamper's integrity is never compromised. FreeTSA trusted timestamping Software as a Service (SaaS) provides an easy method to apply RFC 3161 trusted timestamps to time-sensitive transactions through independently verified and auditable date and UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) sources.&#xD;&#xA;https://www.freetsa.org/index_en.php &#xD;&#xA;">
