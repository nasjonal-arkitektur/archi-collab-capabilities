Using either DNS or HTTP, applications can easily find the services they depend upon.&#xD;&#xA;• Health Checking: Consul clients can provide any number of health checks, either associated with a given service (&quot;is the webserver returning 200 OK&quot;), or with the local node (&quot;is memory utilization below 90%&quot;). This information can be used by an operator to monitor cluster health, and it is used by the service discovery components to route traffic away from unhealthy hosts.&#xD;&#xA;• KV Store: Applications can make use of Consul's hierarchical key/value store for any number of purposes, including dynamic configuration, feature flagging, coordination, leader election, and more. The simple HTTP API makes it easy to use.&#xD;&#xA;• Multi Datacenter: Consul supports multiple datacenters out of the box. This means users of Consul do not have to worry about building additional layers of abstraction to grow to multiple regions.&#xD;&#xA;https://www.consul.io/ &#xD;&#xA;">
