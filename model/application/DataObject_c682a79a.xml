The EUTL is a central transaction log, run by the European Commission, which checks and records all transactions taking place within the trading system. The EU ETS data viewer provides aggregated data by country, by main activity type and by year on the verified emissions, allowances and surrendered units of the more than 12 000 stationary installations reporting under the EU emission trading system, as well as 1400 aircraft operators.&#xD;&#xA;https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/emissions-trading-viewer-1 &#xD;&#xA;">
