    documentation="The delegation mode (centralised or delegated) adopted by organization enablers to implement a public policy. &#xA;&#xA;Based on Hill, M. and Hupe, P, Implementing Public Policy: Governance in Theory and in Practice, SAGE  Publications Ltd 2002  &#xA;&#xA;Syn. Governance of Public Policies&#xA;&#xA;The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB):&#xA;&#xA;Governance of Public Policies in Decentralised Contexts - The Multi-Level Approach&#xA;Multi-level governance is always required for managing public policies in a decentralised context. Multi-level governance (MLG) is the term used to characterise the relationship between public actors situated at different administrative levels. MLG therefore refers to the explicit or implicit sharing of policy-making authority, responsibility, development and implementation at different administrative and territorial levels, i.e. (i) across different ministries and/or public agencies at central government level (upper horizontally), (ii) between different layers of government at local, regional, provincial/state, national and supranational levels (vertically), and (iii) across different actors at sub national level (lower horizontally). “Multi-level governance” approaches often includes also interaction between public and private entities (profit or non profit ones), in particular citizens and businesses. &#xA;https://www.oecd.org/governance/regional-policy/48724565.pdf &#xA;">
