Using a technology called Web Services, the EURES search engine instantly, in real time, interrogates each national database for jobs. These jobs can be of two types:&#xD;&#xA;“EURES jobs&quot;, displayed with a blue flag, which are jobs where an employer has expressed an interest in recruiting from another country, or any other jobs advertised in the national jobs databases.&#xD;&#xA;There is, in addition, a central database where EURES advisers can manually post jobs that will all be flagged as &quot;EURES jobs&quot;. This is for the time being the only way for those few countries that are not yet fully connected to Web Services to advertise jobs on the EURES portal. This solution can, however, also be used for other specific purposes, such as when an employer wishes to publish a vacancy in several languages etc., which may not always be possible in a national database.&#xD;&#xA;https://ec.europa.eu/eures/public/en/advertise-a-job?lang=en&amp;app=1.8.1p6-build-0&amp;pageCode=advertise_job &#xD;&#xA;">
