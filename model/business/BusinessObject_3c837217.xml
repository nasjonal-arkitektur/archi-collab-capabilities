The EIF is an instance of this building block: &quot;The European interoperability framework is a commonly agreed approach to the delivery of European public services in an interoperable manner.

The framework gives specific guidance on how to set up interoperable digital public services.&#xD;&#xA;It offers public administrations 47 concrete recommendations on how to improve governance of their interoperability activities, establish cross-organisational relationships, streamline processes supporting end-to-end digital services, and ensure that both existing and new legislation do not compromise interoperability efforts. &#xD;&#xA;The new EIF is undertaken in the context of the Commission priority to create a Digital Single Market in Europe. The public sector, which accounts for over a quarter of total employment and represents approximately a fifth of the EU’s GDP through public procurement, plays a key role in the Digital Single Market as a regulator, services provider and employer.&#xD;&#xA;The successful implementation of the EIF will improve the quality of European public services and will create an environment where public administrations can collaborate digitally.&#xD;&#xA;https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif_en &#xD;&#xA;">
