Interoperability management method or system&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;INTEROPERABILITY SALIENCY:&#xD;&#xA;The Interoperability Governance ABB  is an interoperability enabler because it helps achieve organisational interoperability as it is &quot; the key to a holistic approach on interoperability, as it brings together all the instruments needed to apply it&quot; (EIF). As stated in EIF Recommendation 20: &quot;Ensure holistic governance of interoperability activities across administrative levels and sectors.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;EXAMPLES:&#xD;&#xA;The following implementations are examples on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;INSPIRE Directive 2007/2/EC of 14 March 2007, Article 18&#xD;&#xA;Member States shall ensure that appropriate structures and mechanisms are designated for coordinating, across the different levels of government, the contributions of all those with an interest in their infrastructures for spatial information. These structures shall coordinate the contributions of, inter alia, users, producers, added-value service providers and coordinating bodies, concerning the identification of relevant data sets, user needs, the provision of information on existing practices and the provision of feedback on the implementation of this Directive.&#xD;&#xA;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32007L0002&amp;from=EN &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Governance defined in the new European Interoperability Framework (EIF)&#xD;&#xA;§ 3.1 of the new EIF Annex II: Interoperability governance refers to decisions on interoperability frameworks, institutional arrangements, organisational structures, roles and responsibilities, policies, agreements and other aspects of ensuring and monitoring interoperability at national and EU levels. The European interoperability framework, the Interoperability Action Plan (Annex 1 to the Communication) and the European interoperability architecture (EIRA) are important parts of interoperability governance at the EU level.&#xD;&#xA;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:2c2f2554-0faf-11e7-8a35-01aa75ed71a1.0017.02/DOC_3&amp;format=PDF  &#xD;&#xA;">
