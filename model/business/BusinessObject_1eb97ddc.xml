A high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities. Union action, which shall complement national policies, shall be directed towards improving public health, preventing physical and mental illness and diseases, and obviating sources of danger to physical and mental health. Such action shall cover the fight against the major health scourges, by promoting research into their causes, their transmission and their prevention, as well as health information and education, and monitoring, early warning of and combating serious cross-border threats to health.

Member States shall, in liaison with the Commission, coordinate among themselves their policies and programmes in the areas referred to in paragraph 1. The Commission may, in close contact with the Member States, take any useful initiative to promote such coordination, in particular initiatives aiming at the establishment of guidelines and indicators, the organisation of exchange of best practice, and the preparation of the necessary elements for periodic monitoring and evaluation. The European Parliament shall be kept fully informed.&#xD;&#xA;3. The Union and the Member States shall foster cooperation with third countries and the competent international organisations in the sphere of public health.&#xD;&#xA;4.

The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may also adopt recommendations for the purposes set out in this Article.&#xD;&#xA;7. Union action shall respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the definition of their health policy and for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care. The responsibilities of the Member States shall include the management of health services and medical care and the allocation of the resources assigned to them. The measures referred to in paragraph 4(a) shall not affect national provisions on the donation or medical use of organs and blood.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:12008E168&amp;from=EN &#xD;&#xA;">
