A Criterion is a rule or a principle that is used to judge, evaluate or test something. An Evidence is a means to prove a Criterion.&#xD;&#xA;- Core Public organisation: describes public organisations in the European Union.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/solutions/core-vocabularies_en &#xD;&#xA;">
