Since a UUID is a fixed size and contains a time field, it is possible for values to rollover.  A UUID can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects across a network. The internal representation of a UUID is a specific sequence of bits in memory, as described in Section 4.  To accurately represent a UUID as a URN, it is necessary to convert the bit sequence to a string representation. Each field is treated as an integer and has its value printed as a zero-filled hexadecimal digit string with the most significant digit first.  The hexadecimal values &quot;a&quot; through &quot;f&quot; are output as lower case characters and are case insensitive on input.&#xD;&#xA;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122 &#xD;&#xA;">
