    documentation="Each organization has different MDM drivers and obstacles, influenced by the number and type of systems, their age, the business processes they support, and how data is used for both transactions and analytics. Drivers often include opportunities to improve customer service and/or operational efficiency, as well as to reduce risks related to privacy and compliance. Obstacles include differences in data meaning and structure between systems. These are often tied to cultural barriers â€“ some business units may not want to incur the costs of changing their processes, even if change is presented as good for the enterprise as a whole.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is relatively easy to define requirements for Master Data within an application. It is more difficult to define standard requirements across applications. Most organizations will want to approach one Master Data subject area, or even one entity, at a time. Prioritize Master Data efforts based on cost / benefit of proposed improvements and on the relative complexity of the Master Data subject area. Start with the simplest category in order to learn from the process.">
