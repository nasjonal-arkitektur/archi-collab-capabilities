The recommended interoperability focus is on semantic interoperability (i.e. data architecture, base registries)  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Option B - The Subsidiary Scenario: &#xD;&#xA;This approach is characteristic of a public policy delegation of powers and a softly regulatory state. The recommended interoperability focus is on legal interoperability (i.e. interoperability frameworks, interoperability reference architecture)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Option C - The Federated Scenario:&#xD;&#xA;This approach is characteristic of a public policy centralisation of powers and a softly regulatory state.  The recommended interoperability focus is on organizational  interoperability (i.e. interoperability agreements)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Option D - The Normative Scenario:&#xD;&#xA;This approach is characteristic of a public policy delegation of powers and a strongly regulatory state. The recommended interoperability focus is on technology  interoperability (i.e. interoperability specifications)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;INTEROPERABILITY SALIENCY:&#xD;&#xA;The Public Policy Implementation Approach ABB is salient for legal interoperability because it influences the way legislation is created to implement a public policy, and sets its focus.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;EXAMPLES:&#xD;&#xA;The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB):&#xD;&#xA;The Customs 2020 Programme&#xD;&#xA;Customs 2020 is an EU cooperation programme providing national customs administrations with the possibility to create and exchange information and expertise. It allows developing and operating major trans-European IT systems in partnership and establishing various human networks by bringing together national officials from across Europe. The programme has a budget of â‚¬ 547.3 million and will run for 7 years from January 1 2014.&#xD;&#xA;https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/customs-cooperation-programmes/customs-2020-programme_en &#xD;&#xA;">
