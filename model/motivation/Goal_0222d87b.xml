    documentation="For the purpose of the EIF, interoperability is the ability of organisations to interact towards mutually beneficial goals, involving the sharing of information and knowledge between these organisations, through the business processes they support, by means of the exchange of data between their ICT systems.&#xA;The interoperability model which is applicable to all digital public services and may also be considered as an integral element of the interoperability-by-design paradigm. It includes: four layers of interoperability: legal, organisational, semantic and technical.&#xA;&#xA;Semantic interoperability ensures that the precise format and meaning of exchanged data and information is preserved and understood throughout exchanges between parties, in other words ‘what is sent is what is understood’. In the EIF, semantic interoperability covers both semantic and syntactic aspects.&#xA;&#xA;Based on the New EIF&#xA;https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/sites/isa/files/eif_brochure_final.pdf">
