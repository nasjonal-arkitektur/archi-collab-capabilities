    documentation="== Context and Typical Flow&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Services Layer consists of all the services defined within the SOA. This layer can be thought of as containing the service descriptions for business capabilities and services as well as their IT manifestation during design time, as well as service contract and descriptions that will be used at runtime.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Service Components or existing enterprise applications (legacy systems, packaged applications, etc.) are responsible for the actual implementation aka realization of a service. At runtime, this implementation will reside in a container within the Operational Systems Layer, which is responsible for runtime.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Services Layer is one of the horizontal layers which provide the business functionality supported in the SOA. The Services Layer is the layer of the SOA which describes functional capabilities of the services in the SOA. The Services Layer introduces the notion of services which are well-defined interfaces for a capability into the architecture with the advent of SOA. The notion of “programming to interfaces rather than implementation” only existed in the programming models such as Java and C++, but was never part of the architectural style until the advent of SOA and services.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This layer primarily provides support for services, from a design-time perspective. In particular, from a design-time perspective this includes assets including service descriptions, contracts, and policies. It defines runtime capabilities for service deployment, but the runtime instantiation of the Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs) enabling these capabilities are housed in the Operational Systems Layer. It also provides the service contract elements that can be created at design time to support subsequent runtime requirements.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Service specifications provide consumers with sufficient detail to locate and invoke the business functions exposed by a provider of the service. Ideally, this is done in a platform-independent manner. Service specifications may include:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* A description of the abstract functionality offered by the service similar to the abstract stage of a WSDL description [6]; note that the use of WSDL is illustrative and the description can be done in any language supporting description of the functionality&#xD;&#xA;* A policy document&#xD;&#xA;* SOA management descriptions&#xD;&#xA;* Attachments that categorize or show service dependencies &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of the services in the Services Layer may represent versions of other services in the set, which implies that a significant successor/predecessor relationship exists between them. The actual home for the various versions of a service should be sought in the Governance Layer which houses and centralizes the service registry and repository.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Services Layer can be thought of as supporting categories of capabilities of the SOA RA:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Functional capabilities aka services that enable business capabilities that business performs to achieve a business outcome or a milestone&#xD;&#xA;* Supporting capabilities to define and specify the “services” in terms of service interface/contract/description, message specification, and policy descriptions&#xD;&#xA;* Supporting capabilities to enable the runtime execution of the service and the support of service virtualization &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These capabilities support the following main responsibilities of the Services Layer:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* To identify and define services&#xD;&#xA;* To provide a container which houses the services&#xD;&#xA;* To provide a registry that virtualizes runtime service access&#xD;&#xA;* The provide a repository to house and maintain service design-time information &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;== Capabilities&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are multiple categories of capabilities that the Services Layer needs to support in the SOA RA.
