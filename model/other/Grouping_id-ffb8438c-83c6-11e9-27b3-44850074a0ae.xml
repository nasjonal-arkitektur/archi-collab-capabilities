The integration can start with modest point-to-point capabilities for tightly-coupled end-points and cover the spectrum to a set of much more intelligent routing, protocol conversion, and other transformation mechanisms often described as, but not limited to, an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).

For example, this is where binding (late or otherwise) of services occurs for process execution.
