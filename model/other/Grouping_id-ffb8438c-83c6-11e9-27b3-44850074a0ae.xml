    documentation="== Context and Typical Flow&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Integration Layer is a key enabler for an SOA as it provides the capability to mediate which includes transformation, routing, and protocol conversion to transport service requests from the service requester to the correct service provider. Thus, it supports the capabilities required for enabling SOA such as routing, protocol support and conversion, messaging/interaction style, support for heterogeneous environment, adapters, service interaction, service enablement, service virtualization, service messaging, message processing, and transformation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is the layer in the SOA RA that supports the integration with solution platforms by the other layers in the SOA RA using “adapters”, the access of services by other layers, and the capabilities associated with service transport. It can be thought of as the plumbing which interconnects the SOA.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This layer enables the service consumer/requestor to connect to the correct service provider through the introduction of a reliable set of capabilities. The integration can start with modest point-to-point capabilities for tightly-coupled end-points and cover the spectrum to a set of much more intelligent routing, protocol conversion, and other transformation mechanisms often described as, but not limited to, an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). WSDL specifies a binding, which implies location where a service is provided, and is one of the mechanisms to define a service contract. An ESB, on the other hand, provides a location-independent mechanism for integration, and service substitution or virtualization.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The integration that occurs here is primarily the integration of Layers 2 through 4 (the “functional” aka horizontal layers of the SOA RA). For example, this is where binding (late or otherwise) of services occurs for process execution. This allows a service to be exposed consistently across multiple customer-facing channels such as web, IVR, XML client, etc. The transformation of response to HTML (for web), VoiceXML (for IVR), XML String, can be done via XSLT functionality supported through a message transformation capability in the Integration Layer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As shown in Usage of the Integration Layer, the Integration Layer:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Provides a level of indirection between the consumer of functionality and its provider. A service consumer interacts with the service provider via the Integration Layer. Hence, each service interface is only exposed via the Integration Layer (e.g., ESB), never directly and point-to-point integration is done at the Integration Layer instead of consumers/requestors doing it themselves.&#xD;&#xA;* Consumers and providers are decoupled; this decoupling allows integration of disparate systems into new solutions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;.Usage of the Integration Layer&#xD;&#xA;image::http://www.opengroup.org/soa/source-book/soa_refarch/i23-0.gif[]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;== Capabilities&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are multiple set of categories of capabilities that the Integration Layer needs to support in the SOA RA.">
